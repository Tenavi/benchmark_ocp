"""
The `open_loop` module contains functions to solve open-loop optimal control
problems (OCPs) for individual initial conditions. There are of course a wide
variety of algorithms to solve such problems, and this module cannot hope to
implement them all. Rather, it provides simple interfaces to some standard
approaches for the problem classes represented in `optimalcontrol`. This module
is intended to be a starting point for generating data for training and testing
optimal feedback control laws.

The methods implemented in `open_loop` are classified as "direct" or "indirect".
These are available through the `method` keyword argument in functions callable
directly from `open_loop`, and are also exposed as the
[`direct`](open_loop/direct) and [`indirect`](open_loop/indirect) submodules.

The direct methods implemented in this module use pseudospectral collocation to
transform the open-loop OCP into a constrained optimization problem, which is
then solved using sequential least squares quadratic programming (SLSQP). See
refs. [1-4] for more details.

The indirect method is to solve the two-point boundary value problem (BVP)
arising from Pontryagin's Maximum Principle (PMP), which provides necessary
conditions for OCPs. This BVP is solved using `scipy.integrate.solve_bvp`. See
refs. [5, 6] for more details.

The direct method is generally considered to be more robust than the indirect
method, which is known to be highly sensitive to the initial guess for the
costates. On the other hand, when successful, the indirect method often yields
more accurate results and can also be faster.

In general, the performance of both approaches depends on the problem scaling,
problem complexity, and the quality of the initial guess provided to the solver.
More information and practical considerations are given in refs. [1-6] below.
